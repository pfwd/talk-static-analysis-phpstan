# There are two types of projects that every programmer deals with during their career

---

# New projects

---

# New projects

- Start for scratch, no code (yet)
- No architectural decisions have been made (yet)
- No frameworks or libraryâ€™s chosen (yet)
- No bugs (yet)
- Shopping list of new requirements
- No end users (yet)

---

# Legacy projects

---

# Legacy projects

- Massive entangled code base
- Mixture of frameworks and library's
- Out of date code
- Older version of PHP
- Incoming change requests

---
# Legacy projects

- No tests
- Lots of known bugs
- Lots of unknown bugs
- Lots of end users. Some are complaining
- Performance issues
- Security concerns
- Low confidence that an upgrade will work

---

# The dream

---

# New projects

Start clean and continue clean

<!--
- Be aware of known issues before deployment
- Gain visual feedback on what code needs to be fixed
- Spot potential gotchas in the new architecture
- Create a CI that reports errors
- Ensure the team follows the same rules
-->
---

# Legacy projects

Quickly identify issues and confidence in our code



<!--
- Be aware of known issues before deployment
- Clean up code smells
- Enforce coding standards and rules in the CI
- Have confidence with the codebase
- Standardize the codebase
-->

# How do we get there

<!--
- Static Analysis is just one of many tools
- PHP mess detection
- PHP code sniffers
- PHP unit tests
-->
